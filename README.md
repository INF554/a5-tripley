However, he doesn’t know how to begin and how other people did already. He wants to find a guide. 
    - Today is Monday, after he opened our website, he would see the most trending topic in different countries, he clicks U.S. button to see what’s popular topic in the United States and how many youtubers publish their videos on Monday based on historical data. He still wants to make the video which totally belongs to him. He wants to customize his channel.
